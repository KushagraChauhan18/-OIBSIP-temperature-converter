Project Description: Temperature Converter

Overview:
The project aims to create a temperature converter application that allows users to convert temperatures between different units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The temperature converter will provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to input temperatures in one unit and instantly see the converted values in other units.

Scope:
The scope of the temperature converter application includes the following key features:

1. Input and Output Fields: Provide input fields for users to enter temperatures in one unit (e.g., Celsius) and display the converted temperatures in other units (e.g., Fahrenheit, Kelvin) in real-time.

2. Unit Selection: Allow users to select the input and output temperature units from a dropdown menu or radio buttons for convenience and flexibility.

3. Conversion Algorithms: Implement accurate conversion algorithms to convert temperatures between different units, ensuring precision and reliability in the converted values.

4. Clear User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls and clear instructions to facilitate easy input and understanding of temperature conversion processes.

5. Error Handling: Handle invalid input gracefully by providing error messages or visual cues to guide users in correcting input errors and preventing incorrect conversions.

Objectives:
The primary objectives of the temperature converter project are as follows:

1. To create a convenient and efficient tool for converting temperatures between different units, catering to the needs of users in various contexts, such as scientific, educational, or everyday use.

2. To provide accurate and reliable temperature conversion results through well-implemented conversion algorithms and error handling mechanisms.

3.To offer a user-friendly interface that enhances usability, accessibility, and overall user experience, encouraging widespread adoption and satisfaction among users.

4. To promote learning and understanding of temperature units and conversion principles through interactive and educational features, such as tooltips or explanatory text.
